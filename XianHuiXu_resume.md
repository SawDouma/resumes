## Summary

I am a Software Engineer who deeply loves programing and like to discuss it with others to improve the software.
I am very concerned about **Software design pattern**ï¼Œ**Coding conventions** and **development efficiency**

## Experience

### **Software Manager** [BobHodings](http://www.bobholdings.com/)

*March 2020 - Present*

I develop the **SDK in Lora Watch**.  This is a watch with built-in Lora, spi lcd, motor, nor flash, NFC.

* Wrapping some unified libraries for example spi, timer, queue, pwm.
* Using FreeRTOS to make device have better response speed, cleaner SW structure and faster development efficiency.
* Classifying and encapsulating the common component in development reasonably, which improves development efficiency.
* Making a Boot that used to update Device Firmware with YModem protocol through virtual UART by USB.
* Managing these HW to control the power consumer in the MCU to low.


I am the main devpoer of **passthrough ble module**. My main contributions are as follows.

* Developing AT command structure based on Nordic SDK. 
* Maintaining the docs about this AT command module.
* Supporting customers to use this module to passthrough data.
  


### **Software Manager** [Dadoutek](http://www.dadoutek.com/)

*February 2018 - March 2020*

I led the development of some different version of **Android App and MCU firmware on smart power supply**. For example: much version of smart power supply, smart switch, human body detect sensor.

* Desiging all of these addtional control commands based on Telink ble mesh protocol.
* Doing much performance enhancement of Telink ble mesh Android library. Such as connection speed, provision speed, improve the max node number and so on.
* Building the base code of Android app and iOS app. And choose what technology we implement.
* Adding many features into Telink ble mesh firmware. Such as magnifying the max number of Scene and Group, designing stabler factory way, gradient dimming, new switch and sensor support.
* Writing the document to help team work together. And in charge of code review.


I develop an assorted **Android App for a translation earphone**.

* Using Microsoft translation API to implement translation feature.
* Implementing IM feature with easemob SDK.
* Encapsulate public libraries to enhance reusability.


### **Field Application Engineer** [Honestar](http://www.honestar.com/)

*June 2014 - February 2018*

I support customers about **Magnetic Sensor chip and Gravity sensor chip**. 

* Help customer engineer fix porting issue about driver and HAL lib in Android system.
* Change some configuration in code to correct the floating problem of Gravity sensor.
* Fix the issue that orientation is not correct in Magnetic Sensor according to different Android phone/pad.


I develop an **Android App** for DOOV, that is using infrared in SmartPhone to control home appliance. My main experience is as follows:

* Use SDK that provides by UEI to implement infrared feature.
* Implement all user interface follow the blueprint provided by UI Designer
* Encapsulate public libraries to enhance reusability. For example: Rxjava, Retrofit, etc.
